<h1 style="text-align:center;">Howdy Folks.</h1>
<p>My name is Jeremy Jacob Francisco, but you can call me - a friend. I'm a CD Major, and I can't wait to 'C D' amazing things I'll be able to accomplish with the skills I learn in this class. Skills such as making bad puns and telling horrible jokes, through the power of coding. In all seriousness, I'm looking forward to being able to make webpages that are visually striking, and also have a fantastic user experience.
