    <h1>Lab 8: CSS Selectors</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to experiment with CSS Selectors.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had no challenges. <span> Okay, I'm lying. </span> The only problem I had was with how to make it so that certain sections of my text was a different color, style, font, etc. I figured it out thanks to the power of collaboration and class provided Google Slides.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>As you can see, I have experimented very much so with CSS Selectors, and now my page is 100% certified <div id="baller">'swag!'</div> <br>

    <p id="test">Here's some extra text, so I can flex my CSS smarts. <br> <span class="boop">So here I am trying to make it so that I can still use the 'span' line, and hopefully it works.</span> <br> Did it work? Let's see.<br>
    It does! But I also discovered that despite being a different class than my last 'span' it still inherits what I had already put in for that 'span.' So I have to essentially recode it so that it's not red, and not italic. Let's try that.<br>
  It worked! Fantastic. Thanks for joining me on this journey of discovery.</p>
