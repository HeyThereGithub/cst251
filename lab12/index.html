  <h1>Lab 12: Advanced Block Level Styling II</h1>
  <p id="text">The purpose of this lab is to experiment further with advanced level block-level styling.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p id="text">The only challenge I had was figuring out what to put onto the page.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p id="text">As you can see, my page is very looking good, and my block-level styling is looking very advanced, again.</p>


<div id="floated">
  <p id="movies">Here's a list of some of my favorite movies, and why.</p>
  <p id="movies">Steve Jobs <br>
  Steve Jobs is one of my favorite movies because rather than showing Steve Jobs as some sort of perfect genius, it goes deeper into the strife and conflicts he had. The movie isn't a 1:1 exact retelling of Steve Jobs' life, as it takes a lot of creative freedoms, but it is extremely well written and shot, and I absolutely love this movie.</p>
  <p id="movies">Goodfellas <br>
  Goodfellas is a movie that I always enjoy watching because of the cast and the story. Anything directed by Martin Scorcese with Robert DeNiro has a chance of being good, and this movie is no different. Ray Liotta really did a good job playing a character that you slowly see progress into this extremely flawed character with a lot of problems.</p>
  <p id="movies">Ratatouille <br>
  Ratatouille is my favorite animated movie, simply because of that one scene where Colette is showing Alfredo the bread, and she crunches the bread. I absolutely love bread. Anyways, the rest of the movie is really good. I like food, and the process of cooking food, and the movie depicts it really well.</p>
  <p id="movies">Jojo Rabbit <br>
  Jojo Rabbit is a movie, which at face value, may seem extremely offputting. I mean, it's about the Nazi Youth. But the movie did surprise me as it was extremely heartwarming and I really enjoyed the characters in the movie. Taika Waititi is a great director, and he plays a might fine Adolf Hitler in this movie.</p>
  <p id="movies">Murder On The Orient Express <br>
  Murder On The Orient Express is a movie adaptation based off of Agatha Christie's very popular mystery novel. All the actors and actresses perform fantastically and they're able to make you wonder who the true suspect it, all the way until the end. Thankfully, I don't read books, so I don't have to complain about how this adaptation wasn't good.</p>

  I'm honestly struggling to figure out what more cool things to start putting onto my website, but hopefully something will hit me. I might just do something else about games. Maybe next lab I will talk about my favorite fighting games.</p>
