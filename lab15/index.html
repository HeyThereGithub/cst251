  <h1>Lab 15: Fancy CSS I</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this lab is to experiment with the fancy CSS we learned in lecture.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>I had no challenges in this lab.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>I believe my page turned out fantastic! I actually do really like this lab page a lot more than the other ones, and that is likely due to the shadows. Makes things, pop.</p>

  <h1 id="cartitle">A Retelling of Jeremy's Drives This Past Week.</h1>
    <div id="foreword">
    <p id="forewordtext">Note that Jeremy is not a car guy, nor does he hope to be one. <br> The most car knowledge he has is from watching reruns of Top Gear and The Grand Tour.</p>
    </div>
  <p id="cartexthead">Jeremy has driven a lot this past week. But where has he driven? And how did he get there? Using what? Sit down, and let me tell you all about Jeremy's drives this past week.</p>
  <p id="cartext">Let's get the basics down first. What does Jeremy drive? Jeremy drives a 2015 Subaru Impreza 2.0i Premium. It gets 28 MPG in the city, and 37 on highways. It has a fuel capacity of 14.5 gallons, and 148 horsepower at 6,200 RPM. It is not stick, and to be quite honest, Jeremy doesn't find that necessary, seeing as he has a personality.<br>
  Now that's out of the way, lets talk about where Jeremy went this week. On Wednesday, Jeremy drove to Cupertino to hang out with a friend. Jeremy's Google Maps was being silly, and took him to Cupertino using the Santa Cruz route, and not the 101. If you don't know what the Santa Cruz 17 route looks like, it looks like this:</p>
    <div id="route">
  <img src="img/route17.png">
    </div>
  <p id="cartext">I know, I know. "But sir, that doesn't look too bad." And it wasn't! Jeremy had a lot of fun on this route, the opposite reaction many other folks have had when he's asked them about driving this way. Route 17 took Jeremy by surprise as it was full of twists and turns and it also held the largest populace of drivers who did not care at all what the speed limit was.<br>
  People were going 70 and 80 in zones marked 45. Jeremy was said people, because cars were passing him, and he fell victim to vehicular peer pressure. Needless to say, on his way back home, Jeremy made sure he took the 101, instead of 17.</p>
  <h2 id="carnext">Wanna know what other drives Jeremy took? Stay tuned for Lab 16.</h2>
