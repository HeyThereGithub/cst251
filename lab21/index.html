  <p id="section3">The results of my lab is this very amazing piece of webpagery. It is very basic, perhaps because I am too lazy to do any extra design work OR I am saving up all my creative juices for when I work with my partners on our webpage.</p>

<p>I didn't get much feedback for my original sketches due to the fact that I was plagued by technical issues. I did look back on my sketches are realized they relied a lot on animations, and branching windows, so perhaps it is best that those sketches weren't looked at as much as my teams' own ideas.</p>
