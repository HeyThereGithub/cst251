  <h1>Lab 13: Typography I</h1>
  <p> The purpose of this lab is to utilize block-level and typography css to recreate a webpage.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>The only challenges Ish and I, Jeremy, faced in this lab was how to stop the html page from being able to scroll to the right. I wanted it like the original webpage, where you could only see a section of his enlarged name.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>I, Jeremy, would say our fake website turned out really well. I believe we captured essentially what kind of aesthetic the original website had, and we did pretty well with out layout.</p>
