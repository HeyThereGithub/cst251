    <h1>Howdy, Folks!</h1>
    <p>My name is Jeremy Jacob Francisco. I'm a Second Year, CD Major here at CSUMB, with a focus on game design. I'm into playing video games, drawing, and talking to people. I like listening to what stories different folks have, I like listening to their experiences, and finding out what makes them, them. I was class clown in high school, but perhaps I've been a clown all my life.</p>
