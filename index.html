    <h1>Jeremy Jacob Francisco</h1>
    <p>Hey there, gangsters! My name is Jeremy Jacob Francisco and I'm a Second Year, CD Major here at CSUMB, with a focus on game design. I'm into playing video games, listening to music, drawing, and talking to people. I like listening to the stories different folks have, I like listening to their experiences, and finding out what makes them, them. Also if you haven't noticed, I like to be humorous and to not take every little thing so seriously. I'm hoping that throughout this class I get to learn more about y'all, and we get to be good buds. <br>I was class clown in high school, but perhaps I've been a clown all my life.</p>
