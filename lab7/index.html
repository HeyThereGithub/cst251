    <h1>Lab 7: Intro To CSS</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab is to make this Lab 7 Index, and to style it using CSS.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>There were no challenges doing this lab, thanks to my amazingly fat brain. I am excited to start using CSS files, and to make my pages look really cool.<br>
    Okay, there was some trouble at first, but once I figured out that to change the size of my photo I had to do a separate CSS code for images, and not just the ID or class, it all clicked into place.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>

    <p>As you can see, I have styled my page, hopefully to my liking! I hope it looks snazzy, and I hope it is pleasing to your eyeballs. The images I chose were of my very cool coding, because I'm proud of it, and everyone should know how cool I am for coding.</p>
