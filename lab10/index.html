    <h1>Lab 10: Styling Text Elements</h1>
    <p id="purpose">The purpose of this lab is to stylize text elements, utilizing CSS.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Challenges? Jeremy Jacob Francisco? Nay. The only challenge I face when doing these labs is trying to find which songs to play as I code, like the pro coder I am.
    <br>In all seriousness, the coding wasn't difficult for me due to how I had already stylized my text in the last lab.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p id="results">As you can see, my text is extremely stylized, and it is oh so pleasing to them lookin' eyes. I hope the fonts I chose are really nice to look at. I chose them because I really liked the contrast of the sharp 'Josefin Sans' and the soft 'Comfortaa.'</p>

    <h2 id="tangent">Jeremy's Tangent About Fighting Games.</h2>
    <p>Here's the portion of the site where I use all this space to talk about something I'm really passionate about. This time, I will be talking about fighting games.
    <br>Fighting games are such a double edged sword for someone like me, someone who is good enough to win against my friends, but lose against people who take the games more seriously. I mean, what a pickle I have found myself in, am I right?
    <br>Now, you might be saying, 'Jeremy, just get better!' Well there's another problem with fighting games! It's rare to find someone to fight against who can both teach you what you're doing wrong, and teach you what you're doing right.
    <br>For example, if you were to fight against someone who was a complete rookie in a fighting game, you'd obviously steamroll them, winning every match. You're not learning anything, you're just reinforcing that you know more than this complete rookie. But take this, and flip it. You're against someone who is a MASTER of the fighting game, and they completely steamroll YOU! Well now you're not learning anything, because you're just getting your ass kicked the entire time.
    <br>The solution? Finding someone who is on par with you. They can be a little worse, or a little better, but as long as you're able to learn, or even teach the skills you know, you're in a good spot. Learning will make you a better player, and teaching will reinforce those things you already know. Fighting games are a constant struggle, due to how the longer a game is around, usually the higher the skill ceiling. The 'Skeiling.' That's not what anyone calls it, but hopefully it catches on.
