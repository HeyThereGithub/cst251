  <h1 id="header">Jeremy's Cool List of Cool Movies.</h1>
  <h3 id="header">Hey, did you always want to hear about what movies I thought were really good? <br> Yeah, okay here you go.</h3>
  <p id="header">
    The first cool movie on my list is <span id="title">STEVE JOBS. </span><br>
      Why Steve Jobs? Because Steve Jobs has some of the best writing that I've ever listened to, and also because Michael Fassbender is in it, and he's a great actor. Also, it doesn't try to paint Steve Jobs as a good guy, but a heavily flawed character. Truly, the movie is enjoyable, and its always a film I catch myself rewatching.<br>
    The second cool movie on my list is <span id="title">RATATOUILLE. </span><br>
      Why Ratatouille? Because Ratatouille is such a good movie, mostly because of the way it showcases food, and the food making process. How does that little rat make all that good food? And how did they get that rat to be such a good voice actor? I don't know, but what I do know is that the movie is absolutely fantastic and it is one of my favorite animated films.<br>
  The third cool movie on my list is <span id="title">GOODFELLAS. </span><br>
      Why Goodfellas? Goodfellas is such a good movie. They should've called it 'Goodfilmas' cause that is what it is, a good film. The acting in this movie is prime, and seeing the complex relationships the characters have with one another is very enjoyable.<br>
  The fourth cool movie on my list is <span id="title">JOJO RABBIT. </span><br>
      Why Jojo Rabbit? Jojo Rabbit is the newest film on my cool film list. I really like this film because it is such a different perspective to the ones you usually get in Hollywood. Director Taika Waititi plays a really good Hitler in this movie.<br>
  The fifth cool movie on my list is <span id="title">HARAKIRI. </span><br>
      Why Harakiri? Harakiri is the oldest movie on my cool film list. It is a great story about revenge and the passing of old values. I think it is one of the only films I've watched in a class, that I have geniunely enjoyed. It was fun to watch this film again after the class was over, because I no longer had to take note of important events. I could just enjoy the movie.<br>
