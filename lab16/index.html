  <h1>Lab 16: Fancy CSS II</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this lab is experiment with the fancy CSS we learned in lecture.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>Unbelievably I actually got the background to work, so I encountered only the linking of the background image to be a challenge.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>This page is definitely not the looker I could've made it, but it hits the requirements.</p>

    <p id="forewordtext">Note that this story is a continuation of the last story. Except, not really, because honestly you could retell both of these stories separately, but whatever.</p>

  <p id="cartexthead">Jeremy has already told you about his awesome drive through the Santa Cruz 17. But now, he's going to tell you all about his drive to Fremont, for a birthday party.</p>
  <p id="cartext">Jeremy drove up to Fremont this week, and thankfully, he took the 101 instead of the 17. The 101 is the major highway that is much more safer than the 17. The drive up to the party wasn't too bad, as Jeremy had only an hour and a half or so to himself, and he had some fantastic tunes to alleviate the loneliness. Jeremy also did drive up to Fremont at 9 PM, due to the fact that he had work that day, and unfortunately, he could not ask for that day off, unless it was 2 weeks in advance. Anyways, Jeremy drove up there, and due to the nightly nature of his drive, did not encounter too much traffic, nor did he ever feel sleepy. After arriving at the home where the party was occuring, Jeremy ate, said hello, then got back in his car to drive to San Jose. But why didn't Jeremy just go to San Jose, then to Fremont? Because Jeremy was going to pick up his sister from a parking garage that wasn't super far, nor super close to her apartment, and Jeremy did not want her to walk alone at night. Jeremy told his family, "I'm gonna go pick up Mikha." What this sounded like to them was "I'm gonna go get Mikha and bring her back here so she can enjoy the party too!" But what Jeremy was really doing was just driving her to a parking garage then to her apartment. So before Jeremy left, he had to convince his sister to come back to Fremont with him, so that his family wouldn't get angry that he just drove to San Jose in order to drop off his sister. Overall, it was a good drive, especially in the nighttime, because it is so calm and quiet. Jeremy is weird because he likes to roll down his windows at night, and feel the freezing wind as he zooms through the roads.</p>
