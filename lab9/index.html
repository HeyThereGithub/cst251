    <h1>Lab 9: Styling Block Elements</h1>
    <p id="purpose">The purpose of this lab is to style block elements, utilizing CSS.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p id="h2">No such thing when it comes to me coding. But this time? I mean it. I actually had a very easy, and enjoyable time making my page look the way I wanted it to, and the coding with the borders and padding was really easy to understand.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>As you can hopefully see, my styling of said block elements has made a very aesthetic and beautiful webpage.
      <br>The margins? <span id="bigword">Immaculate.</span>
      <br>The borders? <span id="bigword">Magical.</span>
      <br>The padding? <span id="bigword">Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.</span>
